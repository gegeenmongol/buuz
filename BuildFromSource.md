You can use Windows Driver Kit 7.0 or later to compile the Buuz source, and to create the installer, you will need NSIS 2.46 or later.

Here are the necessary steps to create a working installer:
  1. Build the source code using the both the "Windows XP x86 Free" and "Windows Server 2003 x64 Free" build environments (using the "build" command)
  1. Compile "buuz.nsi" using NSIS
  1. And, that's it!
