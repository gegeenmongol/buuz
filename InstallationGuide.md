Download the Buuz installer from [here](http://code.google.com/p/buuz/downloads/) and install it, and that should be it. If the "Mongolian (Buuz)" keyboard layout doesn't exist in the language bar after the installation, you can add it manually using the following steps:

  1. Open the Windows Control Panel.
  1. If the Control Panel is in "Category view", select "Date, Time, Language and Regional Options".
  1. Open the "Regional and Language Options" icon.
  1. Choose the "Languages" tab, and then click on the "Details" button.
  1. The Text Services and Input Languages window will appear.
    * Click on the Add button
    * In the "Input Language" menu, select "Mongolian (Cyrillic)"
    * In the "Keyboard layout/IME" menu, select "Buuz (Mongolian)"
    * Click the OK button.
  1. That's it.
